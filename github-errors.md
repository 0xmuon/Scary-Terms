<br>error1 : git tag fails with $'\226git': command not found 
<br>        bash: $'\302\226git': command not found
<br>solution : I have faced same issue and it was because of copy-paste. Typing by hand solves the issue. If you don't want type all the command by hand try to go at the starting of the command after pasting it to the console and click backspace button multiple times. This should remove hidden characters and should work also.
<br>          When you type Ctrl+Shift+V in the terminal it adds the \226 code to the command line. If you type Shift+Insert without attempting any keyboard shortcuts it should work properly.
<br>          Ctrl+Shift+V in git-bash terminal added \302\226ssh
